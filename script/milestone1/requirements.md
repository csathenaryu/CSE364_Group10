## Milestone Description (BlackBoard)   
You should implement Java code that loads the data from those files  
located in /your_git_repo/data, and parse the data to output the  
average rating score of the given motive category rated by the same  
occupation as the user’s. That is, the input to your program is a  
movie category (e.g., Adventure) and the occupation of the user  
(e.g., educator). The expected output is the average rating score of  
all movies in the given category rated by the given occupation. The  
category input can be one or more categories with “|” as a delimiter.  
For example, if the input is Adventure|Comedy, then your program   
must output the average rating score of those movies that belong  
to both Adventure and Comedy categories. The occupation input must   
be only one.
